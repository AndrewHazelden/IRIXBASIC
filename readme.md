#IRIXBASIC
#IRIXBASIC is a simple BASIC interpreter that was developed for the 2012 Summer RetroChallenge. The goal of this project was to add graphics capabilities to the existing uBASIC interpreter and port it to Silicon Graphics IRIX. The program uses SDL for graphics along with the SDL_ttf and SDL_gfx libraries.

The program is based upon uBASIC by Adam Dunkels.
